              <p>You need supplementary software to support an out-of-date system. That old system is clunky and full of technical debt to the point where improvement is nearly impossible. Or maybe you need it to do something that wasn't relevant 10 years ago, but now your school or district needs a system to solve this new problem.</p>
              <p>The first thing you do is head to Google and do a search. You are able to find a few products that <em>almost</em> do what you need. Some are also old. Others only meet half of your requirements. The ones that do meet your requirements are overpriced and they know it. But you'll pay because you need it and they know that, too.</p>
              <p>And good luck finding their pricing anywhere. The closest you can get is a message to "contact sales."</p>
              <p>Unfortunately for you, even after the multiple meetings with sales reps (nothing against sales reps) and getting locked in a 3-year contract, there's still a month-long implementation that is out of your control. You didn't have a choice; they charged you more for the first year for these said "implementation costs." You want to learn how to use this new tool for which you paid so much money?</p>
              <p>Yeah, that's going to cost you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-6 prose prose-primary text-gray-500 lg:mt-0">
              <p><strong>No thanks.</strong></p>
              <p>We've been there more times than we'd like to admit. "That's just how it is," they say. Not for Archboard.</p>
              <p>We're sick of companies giving us (yeah, we're customers too) the run-around and witholding information that is critical to your decision making until you speak with a person. You need to know what the software can do, how much it costs, and what it looks like to run.</p>
              <p>The tools we provide may not be the least expensive, but we strive for them to be of the best quality. You'll always be treated with respect. You can find the features of our tools, play with a demo of the tool, know exactly how much it will cost and have the ability to walk away whenever you want. Implementation costs? Nope. Want to see all of the documentation at any time, even before you buy? Absolutely.</p>
              <p>We won't waste your time. Find what you want, ask questions when you need to, buy when you're ready and walk away when you're done. No hassles and as simple as possible.</p>

          School procedures, methods and requirements are constantly changing. Unfortunately, the software they use doesn't keep up or is too expensive for schools with smaller budgets. International schools are often left out of mostly U.S.-based solutions. We're here to change that.

              Software for education has been around for a long time. We think it hasn't kept up with modern web and application standards.
              We've set out to challenge the status quo for the software that supports education institutions. These are the things for which that we aspire:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Put people first, no exceptions.</li>
              <li>Never compromise quality.</li>
              <li>Provide affordable solutions without a contract (ever).</li>
              <li>Prioritize privacy and security.</li>
              <li>Place simplicity over complexity.</li>
              <li>Communicate clearly and respectfully.</li>
              <li>Strive to be better humans.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For too long, buying education software tools has been a complicated, time-consuming mess. We want to give you the power to make a decision about what you need and when. We respect you too much not to.</p>
            <h3>Weâ€™re here for you</h3>
            <p>Is there something we're missing? A tool you need but can't find? Let us know how we can help you be a hero for your school.</p>
